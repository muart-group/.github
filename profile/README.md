# Mitsubishi UART

First-class ESPHome component targeting Mitsubishi heat pumps via UART.

This organization encompasses several related projects.  The [esphome](https://github.com/muartgroup/esphome) and [esphome-docs](https://github.com/muartgroup/esphome-docs) repositories are used for the development of the `mitsubishi_uart` ESPHome component (based on the initial project [here](https://github.com/Sammy1Am/mitsubishi-uart/)).  Check out the initial project page for documentation on getting started with using the component or development.

For the time being [the wiki](https://github.com/Sammy1Am/mitsubishi-uart/wiki) with development and packet information remains in the previous repository, but will be moved here eventually.

This readme should also eventually be updated to include more information as the project moves from its old location to here.
